## Why I made this project

In this project, Using a 3rd party API from RAWG, I created a video game library in which users can search for their favourite games, developers, genres
or platforms. I created this using Vanilla JS, NodeJS with ExpressJS for the backend, PassportJS for the user
authentication, and SQL for database storage. Users can use the login/signup button to create an account or login to an
existing account, and then create their own wishlists of games by marking each game as "Played, Playing or "Want To
Play".

To search use the navbar and select "Search Games" and use the searchbar to find a game, genre, developer or platform.
Click on the card and the site will take you to a page filled with information, ratings, links and images.

Please note the account creation / login and wishlist pages are a work in progress and may not be fully functional yet.
